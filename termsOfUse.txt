THE PROGRAM SEARCHES THE ARTICULATION POINTS OF USER INPUTTED GRAPH (WITH VISUALIZATION)!

HOW TO EXECUTE: 
1. CREATE/OPEN 'input.txt' FILE
2. WRITE GRAPH VERTICES AND VERGES IN FILE SEPARATING THEM WITH ONE 'SPACE' CHARACTER (MAX: 999 VERTICES)
    EXAMPLE:
    5 (NUMBER OF VERTICES)
    1 2
    1 3
    2 4
    3 5
    3 4
    4 5
    (PROGRAM WILL UNDERSTAND THAT GRAPH HAS 5 VERTICES AND 6 VERGES (TOTAL AMOUNT OF PAIRS))
3. COMPILE THE PROGRAM: g++ main.cpp getDataFromFile.cpp printAdjacencyMatrix.cpp findArticulationPoints.cpp -o out (OR g++ *.cpp -o out)
4. RUN THE PROGRAM: ./out
5. SEE THE RESULTS (ARTICULATION POINTS IN GRAPH AND VIZUALIZATION)
6. TO SEE THE VISUALIZATION OF THE GRAPH, RUN IN THE TERMINAL THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
		feh new.gv
	(
		TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK, YOU MIGHT NEED TO INSTALL SOME PACKAGES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM ALREADY WHICH CAN BE DONE WITH THESE COMMANDS:
			sudo apt install graphviz
			sudo apt install feh
	)
